Comp 20 - Assignment 2

The following items have been implemented
- the map takes up the entire page
- each station on the map is a marker with an icon, and the icon is
  different from the default red marker
- a red polyline connects each station, showing the complete Red Line
  on the map
- a CSS file is used for styling
- the map finds the user location and centers on that location with
  a marker
- when clicking the user location marker, an infowindow appears noting
  the closest Red Line station and its distance away in miles
- a green polyline connects the current location and the nearest subway
  station
- (insert line about JSON API once implemented)

I used the Havershine function from stackoverflow referenced in the assignment

I spent approximately 10ish hours on this assignment
