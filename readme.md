#Kathryn Tweel - Comp 20

##Purpose of this Repository

This repository stores my work for Comp20 from Fall 2016.  Each folder represents the work for a particular assignment or lab.

##Favorite Lab/Assignment

My favorite assignment was 2048.  It was really interesting to look at the interactions between client-side and server side code, and I think it's important to better understand server-side data persistence, and how to build a server that serves the needs of client side code.

##How I've Grown

I've definitely gotten a lot better at looking things up, and taking charge of my own learning to progress in this course.  I've also learned to think more creatively about how to solve problems and how to create effective web programs.

##Most Important Thing I've learned
